## [1.15.2-1.0.6]

I consider the mod finished. I don't think there will be new features in the future.  

### Added
- Trapdoor variant for most of the vanilla blocks. To not interfere with vanilla recipes, trapdoor recipes from this mod are like this :  
```
###
   
###
```
Where # is the block you want convert in trapdoor.  
- Grass Path Slab, Stairs, Fence, Wall and Trapdoor
- Log and Wood can be stripped to get the stripped version of the block. Work with stairs, slabs, fences, walls and trapdoors.
- Secret advancements
- You can convert Coarse Dirt Blocks to Dirt Blocks with a Hoe.
- Grass Block and Mycelium Block variants can spread to all Dirt Blocks.
- Iron Ore Stairs & Wall blasting recipe
- Pumpkin blocks can be sheared to get Carved Pumpkin blocks
- Ore block variants drop xp
- Redstone Ore Slabs, Stairs and Fences light up like Redstone Ore
- Redstone Lamp block variants can now be powered like the vanilla version
- Netherrack block variants can be smelted to obtain nether brick

### Changed
- Minimum Forge version : 31.2.0
- Stairs, slabs, fences and walls variant for leaves block, vine and grass block use overlay/tintindex textures. The color change depending on the biome.
- Concrete Powder Stairs, Slabs, Walls, Fences and Trapdoors have gravity and turn into Concrete upon touching water
- Sand and Gravel block variants are affected by gravity
- Recipes for glass walls don't conflict with glass pane recipe anymore. Recipe for these walls are like the recipes for plank walls

### Removed
- Ore Slab smelting and blasting recipes

## [1.15.2-1.0.5]
### Added
- Patchouli guide book. (WIP)  
If you have the mod Patchouli in you modpack, a book which describe some recipes/loot\_tables from Vanilla Extension will be possible to craft (book+stick).  
Patchouli is not required to launch my mod. It is only required if you want the guide book.  
- Farmland Slab & Farmland Stairs.  
You can have them by tilling grass/dirt slab/stairs
crops on Farmland Stairs are kinda glitchy, but I can't really do something for it.

### Changed
- better textures for Grass Block Slab & Mycelium Slab. The side of the block is now aligned like normal block.
- recipes for plank walls (like oak\_plank\_wall) don't conflict with trapdoors anymore.
The recipes are like :  
```
 # 
###
###
```
Where `#` is a plank.  
And that give 7 walls.
