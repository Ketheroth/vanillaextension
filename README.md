# Vanilla Extension

With this mod most of the vanilla building blocks can be crafted into stairs, slabs and fences.

Stairs are crafted like vanilla ones.  
They also have smelting recipes, for example you can smelt stone stairs to obtain smooth stone stairs, or smelt white terracotta stairs to get white glazed terracotta stairs.  
Rock based stairs can be crafted in the stonecutter.

They act like their vanilla block counterpart upon breaking.  
Example : glass stairs need to be mined with silk touch.  

Slabs and fences have the same properties as stairs.  
Slabs can be reconverted to full blocks.
