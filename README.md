# Vanilla Extension

With this mod all the vanilla building blocks can be crafted into stairs.

Stairs are crafted like vanilla ones.  
They also have smelting recipes, for exemple you can smelt stone stairs to obtain smooth stone stairs, or smelt white terracotta stairs to get white glazed terracotta stairs.  
Rock based stairs can be crafted in the stonecutter.

They act like their vanilla block counterpart upon breaking.  
Exemple : glass stairs need to be mined with silk touch.
