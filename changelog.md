## [1.15.2-1.0.5]
### Added
- Patchouli guide book. (WIP)  
If you have the mod Patchouli in you modpack, a book which describe some recipes/loot\_tables from Vanilla Extension will be possible to craft (book+stick).  
Patchouli is not required to launch my mod. It is only required if you want the guide book.  
- Farmland Slab & Farmland Stairs.  
You can have them by tilling grass/dirt slab/stairs
crops on Farmland Stairs are kinda glitchy, but I can't really do something for it.

### Changed
- better textures for Grass Block Slab & Mycelium Slab. The side of the block is now aligned like normal block.
- recipes for plank walls (like oak\_plank\_wall) don't conflict with trapdoors anymore.
The recipes are like :  
```

```
Where `#` is a plank.  
And that give 7 walls.
